# Group Formation Day | 1:1 Training | Topics for Recap

## Concept

Show up at 8:15 in D17 and we will create group constallations.
We will take the following aspects into considerations:
- Individual working preferences *(work from home, on site, working hours, etc.)*
- Preferred group dynamics *(team roles, responsibilities, individual strengths, etc.)*
- Elective course selections and desires to make joint-course projects *(like combining IoT and fullstack, etc)*

If you already have a group for the exam project, you of course don't have to partake in the group formation.

# 1 : 1 Training

You can book 1 : 1 development training with me here on Moodle (at the very bottom of the Fullstack course page). The concept is as following:

- You can get indvidual personalized help for any topic.
- I recommend you do a small exercise / coding snippet / present your procedure. I will give you personalized feedback and advice on the basis of this. (If you just want to talk / discuss some topic, that's cool too)
- We can do the exercise in a pair-programming fashion.

**The first couple of sessions will all be Wednesday week 14 (2nd of April). After this, I can be booked at any point in time (as long as it is before 2 o'clock). If there should be any calendar conflicts, I will propose a new time**

# Topics for recap lessons

Towards the end of fullstack 2025 you can vote for topics which will get recapped. Since Moodle does not allow for listing of new topics, please message me on Moodle in order to get a new topic on the list (or via email aup@easv.dk)

The topics with most votes or topics that I deem will be extra helpful will be covered.

You can vote at the bottom of this moodle course page.
